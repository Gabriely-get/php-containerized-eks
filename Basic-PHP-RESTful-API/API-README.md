# Basic RESTful API in PHP

## Overview
This project is a simple RESTful API built in native PHP. It serves as a learning resource for those interested in understanding how to create a basic RESTful API from scratch. The API provides endpoints to manage user data, allowing users to perform CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations.

## Features

- Fully implemented in native PHP with minimal dependencies.
- Basic CRUD operations for user data.
- Clean and organized code structure.
- Custom error handling and responses.

## API Endpoints
Here are the available API endpoints:
- Get All Users
    ```bash
    GET /api/users
    ```
    Retrieves a list of all users

- Add New User
    ```bash
    POST /api/users
    ```
    Adds a new user to the database. Requires name, age, and job in the request body.

- Get User by ID
    ```bash
    GET /api/users/:id
    ```
    Retrieves user data for a specified user ID.

- Update User Data
    ```bash
    PATCH /api/users/:id
    ```
    Updates user data for a specified user ID. Requires at least one of the following fields in the request body: **name**, **age**, or **job**.

- Delete User by ID
    ```bash
    DELETE /api/users/:id
    ```
    Deletes the user with the specified user ID.

## Project Structure

The main components of the project include:
- **public**: Contains `index.php` file as entry point for the project
- **config**: Contains configuration files and environment variables.
- **src/routes**: Contains route for HTTP request
- **src/controllers**: Contains logic for handling API requests. Example: `UsersController.php`
- **src/models**: Contains database interaction logic. Example: `User.php`

## Getting Started

To get started with this project, follow the steps below.

### Prerequisites
- PHP 7.4 or higher
- A web server (e.g., Apache, Nginx, or PHP built in web server)
- Composer (for dependency management)

### Installation
1. Clone the repository:
    ```
    git clone https://github.com/FarrelAD/Basic-PHP-RESTful-API.git
    ```
2. Navigate to the project directory:
    ```bash
    cd Basic-PHP-RESTful-API
    ```
3. Install the dependencies:
    ```bash
    composer install
    ```

### Configuration

#### Environment file

Create a **.env** file in the project root directory to store your environment variables. This is essential for configuring database connections and other settings.

Example .env file:
```env
DB_HOST=localhost
DB_USER=root
DB_PASS=my_password
DB_NAME=db_php_restful_api
```

#### Error Log

Create an **error.log** file in the logs directory to store all error logs that occur when the application runs.

```
(root)
├───config
├───logs
│   └───error.log       # This is new file to log the error
├───public
├───src
│   ├───controllers
│   ├───models
│   └───routes
└───vendor
```


## Usage

After setting up the project, you can start the web server first. You can use Apache HTTPD, NGINX or PHP built in web server.

```bash
composer run dev
```

After that, you can access the API endpoints using a tool like Postman or cURL.Below are some examples of how to use the endpoints:

### Get All Users
```bash
curl -X GET http://localhost:8000/api/users
```

### Add New User
```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:8000/api/users -d "name=John Doe&age=30&job=Developer"
```

### Get User By ID
```bash
curl -X GET http://localhost:8000/api/users/1

```

### Update User Data
```bash
curl -X PATCH http://localhost:8000/api/users/1 -d '{"name": "Jane Doe"}'
```
</br>

OR: </br>
```bash
curl -X PATCH http://localhost:8000/api/users/1 -d "{\"name\": \"Jane Doe\"}"
```

### Delete User By ID
```bash
curl -X DELETE http://localhost:8000/api/users/1
```

## Error Handling

### API Response Code
The API includes custom error handling to manage different scenarios, such as:

- 404 Not Found: When a user is not found.
- 400 Bad Request: When the request body is empty or required data is missing.
- 500 Internal Server Error: For unexpected errors during processing.

All responses are returned in JSON format, providing a consistent structure for success and error messages.

### Error Log
All server errors are logged to a file located at **logs/error.log**. This log file can be used to monitor your web application when it is live in production, helping to identify and troubleshoot issues effectively.
